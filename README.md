## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

- **Bash Scripting Course for Cybersecurity**  
  A structured course I am building to help learners understand Bash and Linux+ concepts through practical labs and documentation. This project is designed to go beyond surface-level commands and provide real-world context.  
  - Covers all Linux+ topics in depth through Bash scripting  
  - Step-by-step lab write-ups with explanations of concepts and errors  
  - Error handling and troubleshooting documentation for common mistakes  
  - Full Bash command reference guide for quick lookups  
  - Live video walkthroughs to reinforce learning with demonstrations  
  - Focus on building repeatable workflows for automation and problem solving  

- **Python IOC Scanner (Collaborative)**  
  A Python-based tool designed for security analysts to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) across files and directories.  
  - Loads IOCs from CSV files (hashes, filenames, etc.)  
  - Calculates SHA256 for scanned files and compares against known IOCs  
  - Designed to be modular and extendable for additional IOC types  
  - Collaboration-focused: building with other students to practice teamwork in code development  
  - Intended as a practical resource for entry-level threat hunting and malware triage workflows
